            The idea of BrainyBananas manifested when the founders observed the need to teach the social and life skills to the young minds from an early age. 
            The journey of BrainyBananas goes back to 2012 when the founder Asma Chang envisioned a firm committed to teach beyond the traditional classroom approach. 
            The idea was in its infancy but formed shaped when she met her colleague, Dr. Saeed Mujjahid who shared similar views.  
            The name 'BrainyBananas' was opted for its connotation with fun yet intelligence. 
            The name suggests an easygoing mentor with whom the children can feel at ease with and go nuts while learning at their maximum potential. 
            In short, at BrainyBananas, we are just the right amount of crazy to love our work to bits while taking each aspect of it in the most professional conduct.
